<div class="our-story-header"><h5>Our Story</h5></div>
<div class="our-story"><p>The Organization for Abused and Battered Individuals was founded in 2008, and officially launched in May of
2011. This was a result of the rapid increase in cases of Gender-Based Violence and abuse and its relation to
poverty, mental illness, health, crime, and education. The organisation exists to address the needs of all
women and girls, men and boys and vulnerable persons within Trinidad and Tobago and the wider
Caribbean. It aims to tackle these issues through advocacy, working towards changing cultural and socially
accepted norms about offenders and victims, participate in research, lobby for policies, for legislation to
protect victims and for an efficient and effective judiciary.</p>

<p>Our organisation finds ways to work with law enforcement, encourage sustainable youth development and
assist victims to develop creative innovative business models to become self-sustainable while incorporating
the sustainable development goals, pushing for green growth and gender equity and equality. We
consistently work towards preventative intervention strategies, victim safety, training and education,
alleviating poverty, illiteracy, having open conversations about abuse and mental health, lobbying for
primary prevention intervention, victim advocacy units and a batterers intervention programme. </p>

<p>Violence in any form undermines the fundamental human rights of an individual, and it continues to plague
many families, communities and nations. It is the hope of O.A.B.I to make a positive difference and work
towards a violent free, safe and healthy society for all. We are a member of the Network of NGO s for the
Advancement of Women, The GO Caribbean Development Foundation and we network with various
organisations like WINAD, FPA and others across the Civil Society Sector. We also launched the Anti-Child
Marriage Campaign in 2016 and continue to advocate for the raising of the contractual age for marriage
among many other advocacy topics.</p> </div>
