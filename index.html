<h1>Partners</h1>
<h3>Gender and Child Affairs</h3>
<p>Victims of abuse are at risk of becoming ensnared in a cycle of violence and even of becoming abusers themselves. We all have a responsibility to fulfill children’s rights- to ensure that the lives of boys and girls are free from abuse, neglect and violence. Silence is acceptance.
</p>
<h3>PROSAF of St Lucia</h3>
<p>Surviving Sexual Abuse in the Caribbean is specifically responsible for creating a positive and supportive environment for speaking out against sexual assault and other forms of sexual abuse in St. Lucia and the wider Caribbean.
It aims to draw attention to the various issues that are related to living through various types of sexual violence and to provide support and resources for survivors in St.Lucia & the wider Caribbean.</p>
<h3><abbr title="The National Library and Information System Authority"></abbr>NALIS</h3>
<p>The National Library and Information System Authority is a corporate body established by the NALIS Act No. 18 of 1998 to administer the development and coordination of library and information services in Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
<h3>Living Water Community</h3>
<p>Our Community has a vibrant ministry to the poor in Trinidad – the physically poor and the spiritually poor. In a world where the illiterate, hungry, homeless and destitute spill on to our streets every day, we see the need for basic care, nourishment and self-development programmes managed in an efficient, cost-effective manner. All of this is made possible through the generosity of those who support us by Deeds of Covenant, Donations, Charitable Foundations, Legacies, Fundraising and, of course, our many satisfied customers who visit our Bookstore and Coffee Shop.</p>
<h3><abbr title="Foundation for the Enhancement and Enrichment of Life"></abbr>FEEL</h3>
<p>To collaborate with Civil Society Organisations (CSO’s) to assist disadvantaged persons throughout Trinidad & Tobago. The Foundation for the Enhancement and Enrichment of Life (FEEL) is a registered charitable organisation established in 1992.
We are an umbrella Civil Society Organisation (CSO) which distributes foodstuff, clothing, shoes, hygiene, medical, household, school and disaster relief supplies to our CSO partners and individuals across Trinidad and Tobago. Since 1992 we have worked in communities to assist in the areas of poverty alleviation, disaster relief and recovery education and capacity building, and medical support.</p>
<h3>Family Planning Association of Trinidad and Tobago</h3>
<p>To ensure that every person living in Trinidad and Tobago acknowledges the right to the healthy expression of their sexuality and that all persons including the most vulnerable are supported in realizing this right.</p>
<h3>Mamatoto</h3>
<p>Our mission is to make a safe, respectful and natural childbirth experience available to every woman.</p>
