  <h1> Our Story</h1>

  <div class="our story"></div>
  <p>The Organization for Abused and Battered Individuals was founded in 2008, and officially launched in May of 2011. This was a result of the rapid increase in cases of Gender-Based Violence and abuse and its relation to poverty, mental illness, health, crime, and education. The organisation exists to address the needs of all vulnerable people within Trinidad and Tobago and the wider Caribbean. We hope to tackle these issues through advocacy to change the cultural and social accepted norms about offenders and victims. We also participate in research, lobby for policies, for legislation to protect victims and for an efficient and effective judiciary.</p>

  <p>We find ways to work with law enforcement, encourage sustainable youth development and assist victims to develop creative business models to become self-sustainable while incorporating sustainable development goals, pushing for green growth and gender equity and equality. We also help victims by creating preventative intervention strategies, teaching about victim safety, providing training and education to aid in alleviating poverty and illiteracy. We promote open conversations about abuse and mental health, lobbying for primary prevention intervention, victim advocacy units and a batterers intervention programme. </p>

  <p>Violence in any form undermines the fundamental human rights of an individual, and it continues to plague many families, communities and nations. It is the hope of O.A.B.I to make a positive difference and work towards a violent free, safe and healthy society for all. We are a member of the Network of NGO's for the Advancement of Women, The GO Caribbean Development Foundation and we network with various organisations like WINAD, FPA and others across the Civil Society Sector. We also launched the Anti-Child Marriage Campaign in 2016 and continue to advocate for the raising of the contractual age for marriage among many other advocacy topics.</p>
